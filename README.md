# Kayak iOS Developer Position Test Assignment

## Project Overview

This test assignment was completed for the iOS developer position at Kayak. The project is developed using the MVVM+C architecture and demonstrates a deep knowledge and understanding of modern approaches to iOS application development.

## Application Architecture

The project utilizes the **MVVM+C (Model-View-ViewModel + Coordinator)** architecture, ensuring high modularity, simplified testing, and ease of code maintenance.

### Key Features:

- **UIKit with programmatic UI**: All UI elements are created and configured in code using Autolayout, providing maximum flexibility and control over the app's appearance.

- **Preview for UIView and UIViewController**: To streamline the development process and improve code quality, previews were added for all UI elements, allowing developers and designers to quickly evaluate the look and behavior of the interface.

- **PointFree-like dependencies**: The project employs struct-based dependencies, inspired by PointFree approaches, promoting cleaner and more maintainable code.
